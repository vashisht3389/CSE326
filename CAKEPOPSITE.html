            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small "> I have plenty of step-by-step photos and lots of tips/tricks. I want
                you to understand every instruction so you can follow along and know what the heck you're doing. The
                process isn't difficult you're literally just baking a chocolate cake and making frosting then mixing
                them together. Things just get a little particular when it comes to rolling, lollipop-sticking, and
                dunking/dipping. If you can make bread bowls, you can totally handle cake pops! (They're more fun to eat
                too… sprinkles!)
                By the way, if you've ever eaten store-bought cake pops these taste totally different. They're from
                scratch. No cake mix. No canned frosting. No preservatives. You can actually TASTE the homemade.<br> ♥
                CAKE POPPING PROCESS<br>
                * Make single layer chocolate cake<br>
                * Make just enough homemade chocolate frosting<br>
                * Crumble the cake<br>
                * Mix the two together<br>
                * Form into cake balls<br>
                * Dip the cake balls in chocolate<br>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small ">Preheat the oven to 375 F. Lightly grease a round 6-inch cake pan.
                In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
                In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar together using an electric mixer, approximately 2-3
                minutes. Add egg and vanilla and continue to beat until fully mixed together.
                Slowly add one third of the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, beat until just combined. Then
                alternate with half of the milk. Continue adding and alternating flour mixture and milk to the batter,
                and ending with the flour mixture. Use a spatula scrape down the sides and to stir until just combined.
                Pour batter into the prepared cake pan. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until toothpick comes out clean when
                inserted into the centre of the cake. Allow cake to cool in the cake pan for 30 minutes, then remove
                from pan and place on wire rack until completely cooled.
                <br>
                In a large bowl, use a hand mixer to beat butter until smooth, approximately 2 minutes. Add sugar, milk,
                and vanilla, and continue to beat until smooth.
                Crumble the cooled cake and place into the bowl of frosting. An easy way to crumble is to break the cake
                into big pieces and place it into the Vitamix. A few pulses will turn it into perfect crumbs.
                Using an electric mixer, beat together until combined and smooth, approximately 2 minutes. The cake
                mixture should have a play-doh like consistency.

                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
                In a large bowl, beat cake mix, Champagne, canola oil, and egg whites at medium speed with a mixer until
                smooth. Pour batter into prepared pan.
                Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool in pan for
                about 30 minutes, or until cool enough to handle.
                Using your hands, crumble the cake into a large bowl.
                Using a stand mixer or a hand mixer, combine the can of frosting with the cake crumbs until well
                combined. You should have a mixture that resembles cookie dough.
                Place the bowl in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours or overnight, so that it can chill and firm up a
                bit (this will make it easier to scoop).

                Once the cake dough is cool, line a baking tray with wax paper. Form small round balls with your cake
                mixture by rolling between your palms or by using a melon baller.** If you're using your hands and they
                start to get sticky, just keep them slightly damp with water and the cake dough will not stick to them.
                Place the cake balls on the wax paper. Once you have used all of the cake mixture, place the baking tray
                in the freezer for about 1 hour.
                Melt the white chocolate chips in a glass bowl in the microwave, stirring every 20-30 seconds until
                smooth.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Red Valvet Cakepop</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small ">To start we need to make a Red Velvet Cake and some Cream Cheese
                Frosting. You can make and store the cake balls in the refrigerator 3-4 days before dipping in the candy
                coating. So the steps are - bake the cake, make the frosting, crumble the cake, combine frosting and
                cake crumbs, roll into balls, insert sticks, refrigerate until firm, melt candy coating or white
                chocolate, dip cake balls in coating, and let dry.

                A few notes on ingredients. Candy coating is also known as candy melts, candy wafers, confectionery
                coating, compound coating, bark coating, candy chocolate, or summer coating. It's made from a mixture of
                sugar, milk solids, vegetable oils, flavoring, and coloring, and I think it tastes a lot like sweet
                white chocolate. You can store the candy coating in a cool dry place, usually up to 18 months. But do
                not refrigerate.
                I normally add a little shortening or paramountcrystals (made from palm kernel oil, lecithin, and citric
                acid) to the melted candy coating to make it
                smooth and fluid, so you get a nice, not too thick, candy coating on the cake balls. For the cake pops
                you will need about 25 - 4 1/2 inch (11 cm) long cake pop sticks (known as lollipop or sucker sticks) to
                insert into your cake balls. And you will also need a large thick piece of styrofoam (or florist's foam)
                for drying the cake balls (also makes a nice centerpiece). If you don't have any styrofoam at home, you
                can buy it at cake decorating or craft stores.
